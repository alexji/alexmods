Abstract:
    We study the s-process abundances (A>~90) at the epoch of the solar
    system formation. Asymptotic giant branch yields are computed with an
    updated neutron capture network and updated initial solar abundances.
    We confirm our previous results obtained with a Galactic chemical
    evolution (GCE) model: (1) as suggested by the s-process spread
    observed in disk stars and in presolar meteoritic SiC grains, a
    weighted average of s-process strengths is needed to reproduce the
    solar s distribution of isotopes with A>130; and (2) an additional
    contribution (of about 25%) is required in order to represent the
    solar s-process abundances of isotopes from A=90 to 130. Furthermore,
    we investigate the effect of different internal structures of the
    ^13^C pocket, which may affect the efficiency of the ^13^C({alpha},n)^16^O
    reaction, the major neutron source of the s process. First, keeping
    the same ^13^C profile adopted so far, we modify by a factor of two
    the mass involved in the pocket; second, we assume a flat ^13^C
    profile in the pocket, and we test again the effects of the variation
    of the mass of the pocket. We find that GCE s predictions at the epoch
    of the solar system formation marginally depend on the size and shape
    of the ^13^C pocket once a different weighted range of ^13^C-pocket
    strengths is assumed. We obtain that, independently of the internal
    structure of the ^13^C pocket, the missing solar system s-process
    contribution in the range from A=90 to 130 remains essentially the same.

Description:
    The general structure of the GCE model adopted in this work is the
    same described by Travaglio et al. (2004ApJ...601..864T). The GCE
    model follows the composition of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar
    matter (atomic and molecular gas), and their mutual interaction, in
    the three main zones of the Galaxy, halo, thick disk, and thin disk.
    We concentrate on the chemical evolution inside the solar annulus,
    located 8.5 kpc from the Galactic center. The thin disk is divided
    into independent concentric annuli, and we neglect any dependence on
    Galactocentric radius.

Note (1): Flag as follows:
  b = Note that massive stars may produce a consistent amount of Kr-Rb-Sr-Y-Zr,
      and in minor quantity up to Te-Xe (Pignatari et al. 2010ApJ...710.1557P;
      2013ApJ...762...31P).
  c = An isotope that receives an additional contribution from p-process
      (Travaglio et al. 2011ApJ...739...93T).
Note (2): The main-s component, which is reproduced as an average between AGB
          models of M=1.5 and 3 M_{sun}_ and half solar metallicity, as in
          Arlandini et al. (1999ApJ...525..886A), is also listed for comparison.
Note (3): Flag as follows:
  c = Overabundance with respect to solar (in percentage).
  d = Percentages include the s-contribution (<=1%) by r-only isotopes not
      included in this table (^124^Sn, ^130^Te, ^136^Xe, ^150^Nd).
Note (4): Uncertainties refer to solar abundances by Anders & Grevesse
          (1989GeCoA..53..197A; T04+) and Lodders et al. (2009, LanB, 4, 44;
          Main-s and TW+).
