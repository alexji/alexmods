# alexmods
Basic python modules for science analysis

### Installation:

Currently recommended to install from source.
Go to a directory where you want to keep the code. Then:
```
git clone https://github.com/alexji/alexmods.git
cd alexmods
python setup.py install
```

If you expect to change any code, instead do `python setup.py develop`

`gaiatools` requires [pyia](https://github.com/adrn/pyia), [gala](https://github.com/adrn/gala), [galpy](https://github.com/jobovy/galpy), and [gaia_tools](https://github.com/jobovy/gaia_tools). The last one needs an environment variable set.
